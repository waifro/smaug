# Smaug v0.1
## Search inside every file, folder and subfolder for OSINT
### Windows only at the moment.

It is **not** an online tool. This program scans your local database to search a variable you specified inside each file with bruteforce.

usage:

- Place it (smaug.exe) under the root directory containing all files and subfolders.
- Run cmd.exe inside that folder
- run: smaug.exe <variable> 
- Now you wait till it finishes searching. 

Under development, builds available under release.
