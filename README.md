### Windows builds only at the moment.

It is **not** an online tool. This program scans your local database to search a variable you specified inside each file with bruteforce.
This tool has been created for utility to search inside every file the containing text input, not all files/folders are supported (outside UTF-8 unicode) atm.
Could be useful for osint individuals.

## usage:

- Place it (smaug.exe) under the root directory containing all files and subfolders.
- Run cmd.exe inside that folder
- run: smaug.exe text_variable 
- Now you wait till it finishes searching. 

Under development, builds available under release.
