# Smaug - The OSINT for database's
### Search inside every file, folder and subfolder for OSINT
(based on the book The Hobbit, Smaug the dragon)

### Windows only at the moment.

It is **not** an online tool. This program scans your local database to search a variable you specified inside each file with bruteforce.
This tool has been created for utility to search inside every file the containing text input, not all files/folders are supported (with unsigned char) atm.
Could be useful for osint individuals.

## usage:

- Place it (smaug.exe) under the root directory containing all files and subfolders.
- Run cmd.exe inside that folder
- run: smaug.exe text_variable 
- Now you wait till it finishes searching. 

Under development, builds available under release.
